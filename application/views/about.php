                <p>Well many of you may have heard Reiki but do you really understand what Reiki means and what is its origin and why it is suggested as a complementary therapy by some of the medical practitioner? So lets us understand first the roots of the Reiki.

                </p>

                <p>Everywhere you will get this definition that, the term <strong>“Reiki” comes from the Japanese words “Rei”, which means Universal and “ki” which means Life force Energy</strong>. OK! That’s true though, but, as a layman its might hard for you to understand how this Universal Life Force Energy plays very vital role in our material and non-material life.

                </p>

                <p>Every creature on this planet is made of energy even non material things has energy which is actually sourced from Universal Life Force Energy and the mantra to stay healthy emotionally and physically is proper balance of this energy through nooks and corners of our body. Simply to give an example, as a kids we are always active and energetic as this Universal energy is properly balanced but as we grow old , we encounter more stress which hinders the smooth flow of this life force energy which ultimately results in health illness where it can’t be reached upon .
                </p>

                <p class="mb-5">As a Reiki healer being conduit of this energy we remove these blockages, clear negative aura enlightens you with required Universal life force energy which as a result helps you to lessen the impact of stress, it also relieves tension from entire system helping you to replenish and refocus embarking a striking unique balance in body, mind and spirit.<strong>It is also like with the onset of the Reiki treatment the body’s own healing mechanism starts functioning more efficiently. </strong>

                </p>
                

                <h1 class="title" style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;color:#f98ad8;font-size: 3rem;">Is Reiki harmful?</h1>
                <p>
                    As a newbie to Reiki ,the question whether Reiki will cause any harm will definitely dwindled across your mind .But let me assure you that with Reiki you only earn benefits to rejuvenated the inner being and will never cause harm to anyone either. Reiki works recognising healers’ strong intention and emotion of healing only.
